# TheAmazingMaze
 <p>This is a React app that of an interactive web-based maze game.</p>
 <p>The maze is created is Kruskal's algorithm which is an algorithm used to find the minimum spanning tree in a graph.</p>
 <p>The maze is looked at as a graph with the cells as vertices and walls as edges and that allows the algorithm to work. Kruskal's algorithm uses the UnionFind data structure, which is also implemented in the code</p>
 <p>BFS is used to find the winning path.</p>
<p>TODO:</p>
<p>1. Deploy</p>
